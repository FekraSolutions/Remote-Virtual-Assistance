Sedentary living can set you up for a few health risks; however, there are simple habits, most of which don't cost anything, that can help you improve your life greatly. This article includes ten helpful tips to maintain your well-being, including the 202020 eye rule.
## Understanding the 202020 Eye Rule and Its Importance
Long hours spent before screens are correlated with digital eye strain: a disorder that produces discomfort and potential vision-related ailments. Enter the 202020 eye rule: every 20 minutes spent in front of the screen, you take a 20-second break to stare at something 20 feet away. This procedure relaxes the eye muscles and takes away the tension. Heeding the 202020 rule can be hard concerning task activities, but EyeRelax is one option to set notifications for such breaks.

### 4) Drink Water! More!
Having a water bottle within reach on your work surface so that you may sip on it now and then. The best health benefits come through hydration and, in turn, allow for better concentration levels and energy. 
### 5) Mindfulness and Stress Management 
Employ techniques of mindfulness as meditation or deep-breathing exercises to manage stress. Short mental breaks increase focus and minimize anxiety. 
### 6) Eating Healthy, Even a Little!
Schedule the healthy meals and snacks, fueling the body and mind. Eating a balanced diet builds the immunity and sustains energy levels throughout the day. 
### 7) Set up fences between work and personal life . 
Establish working hours and fix an area designated only for your office work. It will now demarcate personal time from professional tasks and prevent burnout while encouraging a healthier work-life balance.
### 8) Connect with people 
To keep in touch with old colleagues, friends, or family members would definitely help you get good emotional support against that isolation, which is really quite typical in remote working scenarios.
### 9) Sleep Well Every Day! You Deserve It
You should aim to have sleep that is restful and needs 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day. Enough hours of sleep are necessary for the brain to function optimally, keep a balanced mood, and remain generally healthy. 
### 10) Make Regular Health Checkups 
Regular health checkups help in the case of any potential medical issues having been detected early enough and taken care of, and thus keeping you in the best possible health condition for your life.
## Bridging the Gap Between Knowledge and Action
While there is knowledge about these good practices, actual implementation remains sporadic for several. These discrepancies may stem from habit, perceived inconvenience, or the sheer gross underestimation of long-term benefits. Making small changes and realizing your value of these changes can lead to sustainable improvements in health.
